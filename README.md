# Project: Mesto
It is an Instagram like single page website. Here a user is able to edit thier profile and change the avatar, as well as, add and delete their images. Furthermore, users can like pictures of thier own and the other people that are connected to the server. When button for editing is pressed a modal window with inputs will pop up. All the written data in the inputs will be validated and send to the server, so that even after reloading the webpage the users information will be saved.
